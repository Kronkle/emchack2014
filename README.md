EMC Eats

Web app made using Node, Express, MongoDB, and Jade during the EMC Winter 2014 Hackathon. My team used the Cloud9 development
environment for collaboration. Our goal was to learn how to use Cloud9 and the MEAN stack over the course of two days.

This app aggregates survey answers from users about where they want to go to lunch. After a survey is ended, the 
top results are composed into a call to the Google Places API. Relative to EMC's RTP location, relevant restaurant
results are then returned to the screen.
